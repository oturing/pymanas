    <h2>Permutation Poems</h2>
    <h3>Brion Gysin<br />

    1960s<br />
    <!--- I do not know the exact year of the corresponding program.
          The poem was written manually in 1959 and other permutation
          poems were broadcast by the BBC in 1960. "Around 1960" is
          sometimes given as a date. However the Honeywell Series 200
          Model 120, indicated in several places as the computer used,
          was not released until 1965. Please let me know if you
          know that a different computer was used or know the exact
          year in which the permutation poem programs were written.--->

    <a href="http://nickm.com">Nick Montfort</a><br />

    Also: a <a href="permutation_poems.py">Python 2</a> version<br />
    <br />
    This program is deterministic, and presents all permutations of
    whatever words are listed at the top. To see it do something
    different, view source, copy everything, open a text editor, paste
    the HTML &amp; JavaScript that you copied into it, edit the “words”
    list, and save the file. Then, open the file you saved in a
    browser. You can use fewer or more words, too.
